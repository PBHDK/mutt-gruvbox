# A gruvbox color scheme for mutt and neomutt

## Description

[Gruvbox](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox) is a well designed, popular
colorscheme for vim. This is a port to mutt and neomutt, in which vim can act
as mail composer. Further

This is a replication of the repository
[here](https://git.sthu.org/?p=mutt-gruvbox.git;a=summary). The
[website](https://www.sthu.org/code/codesnippets/mutt-gruvbox.html) gives
further informations and a screenshot.


## Usage

The colorscheme is split into two files, where the latter also defines colors
for neomutt. Download the files (or clone the repo) and source them in your `muttrc`:

    source ~/.mutt/colors-gruvbox-shuber.muttrc
    # For neomutt also add this line:
    # source ~/.mutt/colors-gruvbox-shuber-extended.muttrc
